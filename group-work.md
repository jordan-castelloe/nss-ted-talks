# Group Work: A TED Talk by Jordan and Emily

## Why is this important? Why do we keep hitting you over the head with soft skills?
- Our job is to make your hireable and prepare you for your first job. 
- Being able to code helps make you hireable.
- Working in groups, being able to communicate, dealing with people REALLY make you hireable -- these are at least as (and often more) important as/than coding. 

## Soft skills will help you get your first job
- Anecdotal evidence suggests that people with strong people skills consistently have the easiest time finding jobs.
- Being able to communicate clearly about code will help you interview.

## Soft skills will help you keep your first job
- Software development is a team sport! You will be working on a team!
- You can know everything there is to know about code and still totally screw up a project if you don’t communicate clearly with your teammates/ clients/ supervisors about project requirements.


## What's the point of group projects?
- Learning!
- Learning for everyone! 
- It's not about producing an awesome project.
- The best way to make sure everybody learns is to make sure everybody has their hands in the code.
- If the group dynamics are off kilter, the learning process is off kilter.


## Navigating team dynamics can be hard! 
Here are some potential challenges you might run into:
- You feel like you’re behind your teammates!
- You feel like you’re ahead of your teammates!
- A subset of the group does the majority of the work!
- A subset of the group doesn’t contribute very much at all!
- Teammates have different standards for what “good code” looks like!


## Most of the issues can be solved by clear, direct, and ongoing communication.
Communication is also a skill that requires practice and learning - it is a thing you are practicing at NSS as well. If you’re having a problem in a group that communication isn’t solving, come talk to us!


## If you feel like you’re behind your teammates:

#### First: are you really? Could it be an issue of confidence rather than skill level? 
- Maybe some of your teammates communicate with more confidence than they actually feel. (Or they feel it, but they aren’t actually more advanced than you.)
- Maybe you communicate with less confidence than you actually feel. 
If you think it might be a confidence issue, just being aware of it can help. 
- Try communicating with about 50% more confidence than you feel. 
Challenge yourself to say your ideas and opinions out loud even if you think they might be wrong. 
- Try asking questions about other people’s ideas if you don’t understand them.

#### Okay, maybe it’s not a confidence issue and you’re actually behind some of your teammates
- It’s better to be upfront about it than try to fudge your way through - you are not here to prove yourself. You're here to learn!
- You can say something like, “I feel shaky on this, I’m going to go slower and make sure I understand it.” This is totally fine! You don't have to feel bad about that!
- You should understand every line of code in your project. Making sure that happens is about 70% on you and 30% on your teammates.
- Ask to go over code you don’t understand!


## If you feel like you’re ahead of your teammates:
- Ask yourself: are you really? Is it possible that they just communicate differently or less confidently? 
- Don’t do significantly more than your share of the work! 
- Workload should be distributed pretty evenly among group members. If you’re working faster than everybody else, pause and offer to help. 
- Try pair programming - push yourself to communicate more and code less.
- Listen to their input. There’s a good chance they know something you don’t or were paying attention in class when you weren’t.


## If the workload is unevenly distributed:

#### If someone isn’t pulling their weight, it’s usually not an issue of laziness.
- It’s probably (dun dun DUNNNN) A COMMUNICATION ISSUE!
- Maybe they feel like they’re slowing down the rest of the team.
- Maybe they didn’t fully understand the planning process and aren’t sure how to contribute.
- Maybe they’re kind of passive while their other teammates are super proactive.
- Maybe they’re having a bad week.

#### If someone is pulling too much weight, it’s usually not because they’re trying to be a jerk.
- It’s probably (ooomg) ALSO A COMMUNICATION ISSUE!
- Maybe they’re just super stoked about coding and are getting carried away!
- Maybe they haven’t a lot of practice working on teams and don’t realize they’re bulldozing you.
- Maybe they’re super proactive and the other teammates are more passive.

#### How do we fix these things??? COMMUNICATION!
- Communicate how much time you can contribute outside of class before you start a project.
- Touch base as a group throughout the project to make sure everyone knows what they’re supposed to be doing and has the tools and confidence to figure out how to do it
- Communicate what each group member would like to work on (i.e. what they’d like to practice and get better at) before you start coding
- If you’ve tried communicating as a group and the workload isn’t balancing out, communicate with us! Sometimes it is indeed more than just a communication issue, in which case we’ll handle it.


## If there are varying standards about what 'good enough' code looks like:
- There are as many ideas of what “good code” looks like as there are software developers in the universe.
- All code is improvable and we should all be on the lookout for ways to improve it, BUT: 
- Do not rewrite code that someone else wrote without talking to them first.
- Instead, comment on their pull request before they merge it in! Or, you know, talk to them in person. 
- If they are doing it wrong, you should help them, not just ‘fix it’ - again, about learning, not producing. What will make them (and you) into a better developer? Probably communicating.
- Make your critical feedback about the code and the project requirements. (“What if we wrote this function X way instead? Then we’d be able to reuse it later for Y requirement.”) The critical feedback is always about the work and never about the person.
- Strive to not take critical feedback personally. It’s about the work and learning, not about you being a success or a failure. You will fail, you will succeed, but neither define you.
- Critical feedback is always good, and code can always get better, but you’ll have to balance making improvements as you go and just making it work until you get to MVP and then refactoring if/ when you have time
